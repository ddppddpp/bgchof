#### Base Fasting Rules and Single-Day Restrictions ####
On Wednesdays (the day Christ was betrayed) and on Fridays (the day Christ was crussified) the general rule states a value of 4 (cold/cooked plant based food, oil, wine and fish).
On Jan 5 - the day before the Holy Epiphany only cooked plant based food is allowed (value of 2). If Jan 5 falls on a Sat or Sun oil and wine are allowed in addition (so the value becomes a 3)
The same rules are in place for Aug 29 - the Day of the Beheading of St John.
On the Day of the Holy Cross (Sept 14, fixed) plant based food, oil and wine are allowed (3)

#### Resurrection Fast ####
The first fasting period for the year is also the one and the one with the most complex restrictions.
The fasting propper starts seven weeks before Easter Sunday, however before those there is one week of perparation (no restrictions, value 6), followed by one week of dairy/eggs (value 5).
For the rest of the period there are only two days on which eating fish (4) is allowed - the day of Aunnunciation (March 25th, fixed. The exception is only valid if this date is not in the Holy Week, which is true for 20th and 21st centuries) and Palm Sunday (the day before the Holy Week starts)/
Generally, Mondays through Fridays only plant based food is allowed (cold + cooked) with Oil/Wine allowed on the Weekend.
On Good Friday neither food nor water is allowed (the only date with a value of 0 for the whole calendar year).
Starting Easter Sunday for one week there are no restrictions (value of 6), a feast that ends on the Sunday of Thomas.

### St Peter and Paul's Fast ###
This spring fasting period starts on a variable date - on the Monday following the first Sunday after Pentecost (thus it depends on the date of Easter Sunday) and ends on June 29 fixed - the day of St. Peter and Paul.
Obviously the length of the fast is different each year with the extremes of Pentecost being on May 24 (if Easter Sunday is on Apr 4) to Penetecost being on June 30th (Easter Sunday on May 11).
The code dictates that if the fasting period is greater than 14 days, there should be one week fo preparation(no restrictions) following Pentecost. #### Needs validation####
During this period the food that is allowed is cold/cooked plant based, oil, wine and fish (fasting value of 4), except on Wed/Fri when fish is not allowed (value of 3).
